    "# What is Scipy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy is an open source Python library that allows users to perform a multitude of science related programming[[1]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/general.html), and is one of the foundations of the Python Data Science toolkit for analysts, data scientists and more. This allows users to get the benefit of a robust set of mathematical and scientific programming functionality, alongside Python's more general strengths as a programming language. As with many such libraries Scipy is built with Numpy in mind, and like Numpy, Scipy is built to be fast so that it can handle large amounts of data quickly and effectively[[2]](https://scipy.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Scipy can be used for tasks such as optimization, integration and multidimensional image processing, in this notebook I will be concentrating on the Stats module of Scipy, and its functionality surrounding Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scipy.Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scipy.Stats module provides functionality for statistical analyses, and is home to many Python implementations of  the statistical tests that analysts and data scientists need in their day to day work. For example, the T-Test[[3]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_1samp.html#scipy.stats.ttest_1samp), Chi Square Test[[4]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chisquare.html#scipy.stats.chisquare) and ANOVA[[5]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html#scipy.stats.f_oneway) can all be found within Scipy.Stats alongside many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as these tests, Scipy also offers an extended range of summary and frequency statistics that are otherwise not available in Numpy. For example, one can use Numpy to get the mean, median and such for their array, but will have to use Scipy.Stats if they wish to measure the kurtosis [[6]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kurtosis.html#scipy.stats.kurtosis) or skew [[7]](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.skew.html) of that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy also offers functionality for generating random data according to various probability distributions, offering a wider range than is otherwise available via Numpy.Random, such as the mysterious sounding Crystalball Distribution [[8]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.crystalball.html#scipy.stats.crystalball). Users can also transform their data so that it fits specific statistical tests via functions such as Box-Cox[[9]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html#scipy.stats.boxcox) or Yeo-Johnson [[10]](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.yeojohnson.html#scipy.stats.yeojohnson).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the remainder of this notebook, I will be focusing on Scipy.Stats' ANOVA functionality. This includes the ANOVA test itself, the tests to confirm that ANOVA is suitable for the given dataset, and some variations of ANOVA to be used when ANOVA conditions are not totally ideal.\n",

    "# ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of Variance, more commonly referred to as ANOVA, is a statistical test that is used to check if there are significant differences between two or more groups of observations. The test determines whether or not a given  dependent variable (e.g. salary) has a linear relationship with a given independent categorical variable (e.g. ethnicity or education level), and so it belongs the family of Linear Models[[11]](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/user-guide.html#regression-and-linear-models). When using ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the various groups, that they are all equal, and so if the test finds that this null hypothesis is unlikely to be true, we can assume that there are in fact significant differences between the groups. I will be introducing null hypotheses in more depth later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA works by using the mean value of each group of observations, along with the variance of the observations, to calculate an F-statistic. This F-statistic can then be compared to the F distribution (or an F table) to tell us what probability there would be of getting such an extreme F-statistic purely by chance (i.e. if there were no actual difference between the two groups)[[12]](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/f-statistic-value-test/). When assessing the p-value of the F-statistic, it is common practice to accept a p-value less than 0.05 as being \"statistically significant\", as it represents a less than 5% probability that these results were due to chance. Some industries or use-cases may require somewhat different p-value thresholds, depending on the risks of a Type 1 or Type 2 error. See the Hypothesis Testing section for more details on p-values, Type I errors and Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will be introducing One Way ANOVA, which tests for differences on one categorical variable (e.g. ethnic group). Other variations of ANOVA exist that take into account multiple variables, such as Two-way ANOVA which groups observations based on two or more indepedent variables (e.g. gender AND ethic group)[[13]](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/two-way-anova/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "When running experiments or performing observational analysis on different groups, such as would be the case with ANOVA, we must start off with a hypothesis that we wish to test for. This hypothesis clearly details the difference we expect to see from the treatment, or across the various groups, and thus clarifies exactly which measure will be used in the statistical tests to be performed (i.e. ANOVA in this case). For example, in a randomized drug test the hypothesis may be that the drug lowers the blood pressure of the people taking the drug after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "With our initial hypothesis detailing what we expect to see, we can then create a **Null Hypothesis** and an **Alternative Hypothesis**[[14]](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/introstats1/chapter/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/)[[15]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/01/an-introduction-to-hypothesis-testing/). The alternative hypothesis is simply the change that you anticipate. So in my prior example, the alternate hypothesis would be \"patients that take this drug have lower blood pressure by 5% after X amount of time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile the null hypothesis is opposite of the alternative hypothesis, and states that there is no change or meaningful difference between the groups. In the drug trial example, the null Hypothesis would be \"patients that take this drug see no change in their blood pressure after x amount of time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As the analysis is performed, it is the null hypothesis that is assumed to be true until we find statistically significant evidence that it can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis accepted. It should be noted that the term \"hypothesis\" is used here for good reason, as rejecting the null hypothesis does not necessarily mean that the alternative hypothesis is the true cause of the change or difference, but that without other alternative hypotheses it can be accepted until such a time as it too is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the p-value kicks in. The p-value tells us the probability of having encountered results as extreme as the results found in the given analysis if there were no notable difference. If the p-value is high, then the probability of the results being down to chance is high, and therefore there isn't sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, if the p-value is low (usually below 0.05) then the null hypothesis can be confidently rejected, and the alternative hypothesis accepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis and threshold for the p-value is set before the experiment or analysis begins, so as to prevent \"P-Hacking\" whereby results can be massaged or thresholds changed in order to promote a seemingly statistically significant result, that otherwise wouldn't have rejected the null hypothesis [[16]](https://scienceinthenewsroom.org/resources/statistical-p-hacking-explained/). P-Hacking is not necessarily a conscious decision, as our own biases can mean we accept results that otherwise wouldn't be significant, and so it's important that we set the thresholds before we begin the analysis so that these errors don't crop up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I & Type II Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "We use p-values as a threshold for whether or not to reject a null hypothesis, as it limits the likelihood of an error being made. In hypothesis testing, errors fall into two main categories known as **Type I Errors** and **Type II Errors**[[17]](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/type-i-and-type-ii-errors/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I Errors are false positive results. In these situations the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually the more correct of the two hypotheses. By setting a p-value threshold of 5% or lower, we will only reject the null hypothesis if our results would only be this extreme 5% or less of the time. This means we can at least be confident that our results are at least 95% likely to be significant, and so the risk of a type I error having occurred is 5% or less. However, if P-hacking has taken place, then the likelihood of a type I error increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II Errors are false negatives. In these situations the null hypothesis was not rejected, when it actually should. This may be due to the distribution of the observed samples not fully representing the population, or that the measure used in the analysis was not the one that was actually impacted. The risk of type II errors can be reduced by increasing the statistical power of the analysis by increasing the sample size, increasing the size of the effect we are measuring for (e.g. instead of looking for a 5% improvement, look for 10%), or by raising the p-value threshold (with obvious knock on effects for more potential type 1 errors). \n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of type I and type II errors is often depicted on a matrix[[18]](https://towardsdatascience.com/type-i-type-ii-error-simplified-covid-vaccine-example-c99b31ddbf41), such as in this illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/OtherBrian/machine-learning/blob/main/images/errors.png?raw=true\" alt=\"example of classifier\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "While analysts aim to avoid either error when designing their experiments, type I errors are generally seen as the more critical of the two. This is because a type I error results in rejecting the null hypothesis, and thus accepting a new insight and possibly new actions as a result. On the other hand, a type II error maintains the status quo. In most scenarios, taking action based on a type I error has the potential to cause more damage then carrying on with the status quo (as would be the case with a type II error). This may not be true in all scenarios, as there may be situations where inaction is the larger risk. This can lead to certain industries, or even just specific experiments, utilizing different p-value thresholds dependent on where the larger risk is. \n",

    "# The ANOVA formula\n",

    "### Total Sum of Squares - SS(Total)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with regression analysis, you'll likely recognise the term \"sum of squares\" within the name of this value. In regression, the sum of squares would involve comparing the model's predicted values to the actual values, squaring those differences and then summing them so as to give us a measure of the model's accuracy. In the case of ANOVA, the model isn't making a prediction as such, however we do still want to know the dispersion of points, and so the sum of squares can provide that context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll be going through each of the observations one by one, minusing the overall mean from it, and squaring that difference. We then sum all of those squares differences to give us the Total Sum of Squares. The formula for this is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SS(Total) = \\sum^{N}(X_{ij} - \\bar{X})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$ is the total number of observations across all of the groups combined\n",
    "* $X_{ij}$ is the j'th observation from the i'th group\n",
    "* $\\bar{X}$ is the overall mean (i.e. the mean of the dependent variable across all of the groups combined\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Total Sum of Squares, we now know the variability across all of the groups combined (i.e. the full dataset). The next step is to see if any of the groups contribute more to that variability than others. In order to do this, we'll need the Sum of Squares Treatment ($SST$) and Sum of Squares Error ($SSE$), as they will actually be used for the $F$ statistic formula itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum of Squares Treatment (SST) & Mean Squared Treatment (MST)\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we'll look at the Sum of Squares Treatment ($SST$) as this will go towards our numerator in the $F$ statistic formula. The formula for $SST$ looks much the same as the formula for SS(Total), however we're now comparing the mean of each individual group against the overall mean. Again we square this difference, and sum them to get our $SST$ across the groups. The formula is:\n",

    "* $\\bar{X}_j$ is the mean of the given group\n",
    "* $X$ is the overall population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the $SST$, we must divide it by the Degrees of Freedom for our treatment ($df_T$). This is simply the total number of groups ($k$) minus 1. So if we have 4 groups, the degrees of freedom for the treatment would be 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "df_T = k - 1\n",
    "$$\n",

    "MST = \\frac{SST}{df_T}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "If there's not much difference between the overall mean and the means of each group, then our $SST$ will be quite small, thus leading to a smaller numerator in the final ANOVA formula. If there are significant differences between the group means and the overall mean the $SST$, and later $MST$, will be larger. However, if there is a lot of variation within the groups, we may end up with a larger denominator which evens this out and keeps the $F$ statistic lower.\n",

    "### Sum of Squares Error (SSE) & Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the $SST$ is looking at the differences in the means of each group, the $SSE$ measures the variation within each group.

In actual fact it's shape may differ somewhat depending on the parameters involved, but as we can see from this illustration, the higher the $F$ statistic is, the lower the p-value associated with it. This will only occur if the $MST$ is greater than the $MSE$, which does make sense when we look at the final formula for the $F$ statistic. \n",

    "# When can we use ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all datasets are suitable for a standard ANOVA analysis, and so there are six guiding assumptions[[21]](https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/one-way-anova-using-spss-statistics.php) that should apply to a dataset before applying the ANOVA technique. In the event that one or more of these guiding assumptions are not met, there may be alternative versions of ANOVA available, or else the analyst will have to explore other analysis techniques to use in their situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The dependent variable is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ANOVA uses the mean and variance to compare the dependent variable in each group, it is therefore important that the dependent variable itself is continuous. For example variance generally cannot be measured on categorical variables, and so wouldn't provide one of the key measures necessary for ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The independent variables are spread across at least 2 or 3 groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with ANOVA is to see if the dependent variable is sufficiently different between each group within the dataset, and so it figures that we would need a few distinct groups to perform the analysis on. Therefore a minimum of 2 groups are required, although it should be noted that when there are just 2 groups present, we could use a T test instead of ANOVA[[22]](https://www.statology.org/what-is-the-difference-between-a-t-test-and-an-anova/). The benefits of ANOVA really kick in once we get to 3 groups or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Observations must be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation should not be impacted by the other observations in its own group, or in the groups around it. In the event that observations are not completely independent, we may see our results impacted by bias and external factors[[23]](https://www.statisticshowto.com/assumption-of-independence/). For example if we look at the salary of three students after 15 years, these measures will be independent (most of the time) as the salary of one student should not impact the salary of another. However, if we are measuring how many grams of cake were eaten at a party by the three students, and there's a limited supply of cake, then we may see that one students cake eating capacity was hampered by the voraciousness of another student and thus the results would be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. No significant outliers should be present within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA uses variance and mean in order to compare the groups within the dataset, and so any outliers have the potential to significantly skew those two measures and thus impact the results. Using the students example above, if one of those students was Mark Zuckerberg then we might conclude that dropping out of college leads to the highest salary after 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. The dependent variable should be normally distributed for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "As variance and mean are the two measures used to compare the groups, we should ensure that the distributions are approximately normally distributed. We can do this by plotting the dependent variable into a histogram for each group, or make use of some handy statistical tests which I'll be introducing later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. There should be homogeneity of variances\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as variance is one of the main measures being used for ANOVA, it's important that the variances are somewhat similar. If one of the groups has a variance that is significantly different to the others (i.e. very low and very high values) then it will impact the trustworthiness of our results.\n",

    "As mentioned above, there are workarounds and other flavours of ANOVA available if one or more of these assumptions are not met. I will introduce some of these when we go through the Students dataset later.

If we run multiple tests, each with a 5% chance of having a type I error, then the likelihood of there being at least one type 1 error increases as we do more tests[[30]](https://statisticsbyjim.com/anova/post-hoc-tests-anova/).

    "For situations like this where we've been able to use standard ANOVA due to all six ANOVA assumptions having been met, we are able to use the Tukey's HSD test to see which groups differ from the others[[32]](https://sciencing.com/what-is-the-tukey-hsd-test-12751748.html). At the time of writing Scipy.stats does not include this feature, and so I will be using another popular statistical library called Statsmodels[[33]](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.multicomp.pairwise_tukeyhsd.html). It's also worth pointing out that whereas Scipy.stats is more geared towards arrays (hence why we split the original dataframe into one for each diet), Statsmodels is aimed more at Pandas Dataframes, so I will be using the original diet_df here."

I sourced this dataset from Kaggle [[47]](https://www.kaggle.com/conorrot/irish-weather-hourly-data), and it includes the hourly weather measurements from numerous weather stations across Ireland from January 1st 1990 to June 1st 2020. Needless to say, the original dataset is massive, and so I've just taken the Athenry data to show here."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I have introduced one-way ANOVA and some of the variations and alternative tests available to us when our data doesn't meet the assumptions necessary for ANOVA. I have also introduced Scipy.Stats, and how we can use it to perform ANOVA, as well as the other Python libraries required for the various flavours of ANOVA we have encountered. Finally I've provided an alternative to the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality for large datasets, as otherwise the results can be unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has not been an exhaustive introduction to ANOVA, as there is still two-way ANOVA, ANCOVA and other variants available to us. These take into account multiple independent variables, which results in many more smaller groups for which we can test for significant differences. I decided to concentrate on one-way ANOVA here, and provide a more comprehensive overview of this valuable analysis technique.\n",

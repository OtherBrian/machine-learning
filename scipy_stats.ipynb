    "# What is Scipy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy is an open source Python library that allows users to perform a multitude of science related programming (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/index.html#user-guide), and is one of the foundations of the Python Data Science toolkit for analysts, data scientists and more. As with many such libraries Scipy is built with Numpy in mind, and like Numpy, Scipy is built to be fast so that it can handle large amounts of data quickly and effectively (https://scipy.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "While Scipy can be used for tasks such as optimization, integration and multidimensional image processing(, in this notebook I will be concentrating on the Stats subpackage. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scipy.Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scipy.Stats sub-package provides functionality for statistical analyses, and is home to the Python implementations of many of the statistical tests that analysts and data scientists need in their day to day work. For example, the T-Test (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_1samp.html#scipy.stats.ttest_1samp), Chi Square Test (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chisquare.html#scipy.stats.chisquare) and ANOVA (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html#scipy.stats.f_oneway) can all be found within Scipy.Stats alongside many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as these tests, Scipy also offers an extended range of summary and frequency statistics that are otherwise not available in Numpy. For example, one use Numpy to get the mean, median and such for their array, but will have to use Scipy.Stats if they wish to measure the kurtosis (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kurtosis.html#scipy.stats.kurtosis) or skew (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.skew.html) of that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy also offers functionality for generating random data according to various probability distributions, offering a wider range than is otherwise available via Numpy.Random, such as mysterious sounding Crystalball Distribution (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.crystalball.html#scipy.stats.crystalball). Users can also transform their data so that it fits specific statistical tests via functions such as Box-Cox(https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html#scipy.stats.boxcox) or Yeo-Johnson (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.yeojohnson.html#scipy.stats.yeojohnson).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the remainder of this notebook, I will be focusing on Scipy.Stats ANOVA functionality. This includes the ANOVA (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html#scipy.stats.f_oneway) test itself, the tests to confirm that ANOVA is suitable for the given dataset, and some variations of ANOVA to be used when ANOVA conditions are not totally ideal."

    "# ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of Variance tests, more commonly referred to as ANOVA, is a statistical test that is used to check whether two or more groups from within a given population have significant differences. It does this by comparing the variance of the observations within each group as well as taking the mean value of each group into account(https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/research/anova/), and producing an F statistic which can be used to derive a P-Value. This P-Value tells us what probability there would be of getting such an extreme F statistic purely by chance (i.e. if there were no actual difference between the two groups) (https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/f-statistic-value-test/), and so it's common practice to accepted a P-Value less than 0.05 as being \"statistically significant\", as it represents a less than 5% probability that these results were due to chance. Some industries or use-cases may require somewhat different P-Value thresholds, depending on the risks of a Type 1 or Type 2 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "When running experiments or performing observational analysis on different groups, such as would be the case with ANOVA, we must start off with a hypothesis that we wish to test for. This hypothesis clearly details the difference we expect to see from the treatment, or across the various groups, and thus clarifies exactly which measure will be used in the statistical tests to be performed (i.e. ANOVA in this case). For example, in a randomized drug test the hypothesis may be that the drug lowers the blood pressure of the people taking the drug after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null and Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "With our initial hypothesis detailing what we expect to see, we can then create a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis. The alternate hypothesis is simply that change that you anticipate. So in my prior example, the alternate hypothesis would be \"patients that take this drug have lower blood pressure by 5% after X amount of time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile the Null Hypothesis is opposite of the Alternate Hypothesis, and stats that there is no change or meaningful difference between groups. In the drug trial example, the null hypothesis would be \"patients that take this drug see no change in their blood pressure after x amount of time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As the analysis is performed, it is the null hypothesis that is assumed to be true until we find statistically significant evidence that it can be rejected and the alternate hypothesis accepted. It should be noted that the term \"hypothesis\" is used here for good reason, as rejecting the null hypothesis does not necessarily mean that the alternate hypothesis is the true cause of the change or difference, but that without other alternative hypotheses it can be accepted until such a time as it to is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the P-Value kicks in. The P-Value tells us the probability of having encountered results as extreme as the results found in the given analysis if there were no notable difference. If the P-Value is high, then the probability of the results being down to chance is high, and therefore there isn't sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, if the P-Value is low (usually below 0.05) then the null hypothesis can be confidently rejected, and the alternate hypothesis accepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis and threshold for the P-Value is set before the experiment or analysis begins, so as to prevent \"P-Hacking\" whereby results can be massaged or thresholds changed in order to promote a seemingly stastically significant result, that otherwise wouldn't have rejected the null hypothesis (https://scienceinthenewsroom.org/resources/statistical-p-hacking-explained/). P-Hacking is not neccessarily a conscious decision, as our own biases can mean we accept results that otherwise wouldn't be significant, and so it's important that we set the thresholds before we begin the analysis so that these errors don't crop up.\n",
    "\n",
    "(https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/01/an-introduction-to-hypothesis-testing/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I & Type II Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "We use P-Values as a threshold for whether or not to reject a null hypothesis, as it limits the likelihood of an error being made. In hypothesis testing, errors fall into two main categories known as Type I Errors and Type II Errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I Errors are false positive results. In these situations the null hypothesis would be rejected when it's actually the more correct of the two hypotheses. By setting a P-Value threshold of 5% or lower,  we will only reject the null hypothesis if our results would only be this extreme 5% or less of the time. This means we can at least be confident that our results at least 95% likely to be significant, and so the risk of a Type I error having occured is 5% or less. However, if P-hacking has taken place, then the likelihood of a Type I error increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II Errors are false negatives. In these situations the null hypothesis was not rejected, when it actually should. This may be due to the distribution of the observed samples not fully representing the population, or that the measure used in the analysis was not the one that was actually impacted. The risk of type II errors can be reduced by increasing the statistiacl power of the analysis by increaseing the sample size, increasing the size of the effect we are measuring for (e.g. instead of looking for a 5% improvement, look for 10%), or by raising the P-Value threshold (with obvious knock on effects for more potential Type 1 errors). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/OtherBrian/machine-learning/blob/main/images/errors.png?raw=true\" alt=\"example of classifier\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "While analysts aim to avoid either error when designing their experiments, Type I errors are generally seen as the more critical of the two. This is because a Type I Error rejecting the null hypothesis, and thus accepting a new insight and possibly new actions as a result, whereas a Type II Error maintains the status quo. In most scenarios, taking action based on a Type I Error has the potential to cause more damage then carrying on with the status quo (as would be the case with a Type II error). This may not be true in all scenarios, as there may be situations where inaction is the larger risk.\n",

    "## When can we use ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/one-way-anova-using-spss-statistics.php\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all datasets are suitable for a standard ANOVA analysis, and so there are six guiding assumptions that should apply to a dataset before applying the ANOVA technique. In the event that one or more of these guiding assumptions are not met, there may be alternative versions of ANOVA available, or else the analyst will have to explore other analysis techniques to use in their situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The dependent variable is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ANOVA uses the mean and variance to compare the dependent variable in each group, it is therefore important that the dependent variable itself is continuous. For example variance generally cannot be measured on categorical variables, and so wouldn't provide one of the key measures necessary for ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The independent variables are spread across at least 2 or 3 groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with ANOVA is to see if the dependent variable is sufficiently different between each group within the dataset, and so it figures that we would need a few distinct groups to perform the analysis on. Therefore a minimum of 2 groups are required, although it should be noted that when there are just 2 groups present, we could use an T test instead of ANOVA. The benefits of ANOVA really kick in once we get to 3 groups or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Observations must be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation should not be impacted by the other observations in its own group, or in the groups around it. In the event that observations are not completely independent, we may see our results impacted by bias and external factors. For example if we look at the salary of three students after 15 years, these measures will be independent (most of the time) as the salary of one student should not impact the salary of another. However, if we are measuring how many grams of cake were eaten at a party by the three students, and there's a limited supply of cake, then we may see that one students cake eating capacity was hampered by the voraciousness of another student and thus the results would be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. No significant outliers should be present within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA uses variance and mean in order to compare the groups within the dataset, and so any outliers have the potential to significantly skew those two measures and thus impact the results. Using the students example above, if one of those students was Mark Zuckerberg then we might conclude that dropping out of college leads to the highest salary after 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The dependent variable should be normally distributed for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "As variance and mean are the two measures used to compare the groups, we should ensure that the distributions are approximately normally distributed. We can do this by plotting the dependent variable into a histogram for each group, or make use of some handy statistical tests which I'll be introducing later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. There should be homogeneity of variances\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as Variance is one of the main measures being used for ANOVA, it's important that the variances are somewhat similar. If one of the groups has a variance that is significantly different to the others (i.e. very low and very high values) then it will impact the trustworthiness of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, there are workarounds and other flavours of ANOVA available if one or more of these assumptions are not met. I will introduce some of these when we go through the Students dataset later. For now though, let's go through a dataset that is perfectly ideal for ANOVA and meets all of these assumptions - the diet dataset."

However, if we run multiple tests, each with a 5% chance of having a Type 1 error, then the likelihood of there being at least one Type 1 error increases as we do more tests(https://statisticsbyjim.com/anova/post-hoc-tests-anova/).

At the time of writing Scipy.stats does not include this feature, and so I will be using another popular statistical library called Statsmodels.
